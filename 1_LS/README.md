## Latent space (LS): Figures 2,4,5,8

To generate Figures 2, 4, 5 and assets for Figure 8, run the following commands with the proper [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install) environment sourced:

- `python DifussionMaps_LS.py`
- `python AnalyticalForm.py`

For figures with multiple isolated subplots, each subplot can be rendered by selecting predesigned choices in the user parameters section of the respective script. Figure assets will render to the folder `_figure_assets_`.
