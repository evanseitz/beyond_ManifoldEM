# beyond_ManifoldEM
This repository contains code for generating results shown in our paper Beyond ManifoldEM: Geometric relationships between manifold embeddings of a continuum of 3D molecular structures and their 2D projections (Seitz, Frank and Schwander): https://www.TBD.com. This work was developed in the Frank research group at Columbia University in collaboration with Peter Schwander at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM).

The algorithms presented here in their current form are developed for analyzing synthetic data. Custom synthetic datasets can be generated using code in our [previous repository](https://github.com/evanseitz/cryoEM_synthetic_continua) with additional information provided in the corresponding [previous paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/864116v1): **Simulation of Cryo-EM Ensembles from Atomic Models of Molecules Exhibiting Continuous Conformations** (Seitz, Acosta-Reyes, Schwander, Frank*). We have also deposited our complete synthetic dataset in the [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/manifoldem-esper-data-and-code-repository), which is a mirror of the 2019 repository with the addition of several refinements for processing the provided data.

Users interested in applying these methods to experimental datasets should consult the [ManifoldEM Matlab suite](https://github.com/GMashayekhi/ManifoldEM_Matlab) or [ManifoldEM Python suite](https://github.com/evanseitz/ManifoldEM_Python), with the latter featuring a comprehensive GUI, user manual and robust automation strategies. As well, our [ManifoldEM ESPER method] can be used to further refine ManifoldEM outputs given certain prerequisites are met, with detailed information provided in our [ESPER paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9773954): **Recovery of Conformational Continuum From Single-Particle Cryo-EM Images: Optimization of ManifoldEM Informed by Ground Truth** (Seitz, Acosta-Reyes, Maji, Schwander, Frank*)
