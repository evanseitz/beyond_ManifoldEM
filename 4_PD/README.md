## Figure 11 and Figure 14

To generate Figures 9,10,11 and 14, run the following commands with the proper [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install) environment sourced:

- `bash 1_Dist_Batch.sh`
- `bash 2_DM_Batch.sh`

Figure assets will render to the folders `Data_Distances` and `Data_Manifolds`.

All scripts and data are selected from the [ESPER repository](https://github.com/evanseitz/ManifoldEM_ESPER), with the .mrcs files taken directly from the `ManifoldEM_ESPER/0_Data_Inputs/2_PDs_2D/` folder.
